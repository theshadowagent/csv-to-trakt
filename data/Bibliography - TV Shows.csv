2020-01-19,4,2,Mr Robot,
2020-01-19,4,3,Mr Robot,"how did she not comment on him having gotten fully dressed and putting his shoes on in order to look for aspirin, also didnt get any aspirin either"
2020-01-19,4,4,Mr Robot,"how did he get shot in the stomach from a window height, why did the guy just shoot assuming it was them? it could have been anyone, overall did not like this website, seemed dumb and pointless and nothing moved forward"
2020-01-20,4,5,Mr Robot,not that into this episode either
2020-01-20,4,6,Mr Robot,- still prefer episode 1-3
2020-01-20,4,7,Mr Robot,"(Slept then interrupted with DND) very stylized, pretty good especially as it built up, totally saw vera dying, i thought the two guys who were listening just went into the other room, they really left completely?, knife was so obviously foreshadowed too"
2020-01-20,4,8,Mr Robot,"are all these guys just working on christmas when they come in and kidnap people, what if they hadn't been used are they on call. really they kept the gun on her. also i saw the tomorrow museum talking about alternate realities"
2020-01-20,4,9,Mr Robot,pretty good episode i liked it
2020-01-20,4,10,Mr Robot,"didn't really like dialogue between dom and darlene, seems like talking around each other, can't they just take a holiday wtf, also def true darlene sucks alone she gonna die of OD, why cnat darlene just stay with dom, isnt she meant to have an injury, lol wtf is with them missing eahc other"
2020-01-20,4,11,Mr Robot,"how tf does he know anything about melt downs and stuff, how does he know itll destroy the whole town, nuclear reactors are actually quite safe why would there be explosionms and shit unless it already broke, if that happened they're already fucked so, wondering where this alternate timeline stuff will go"
2020-01-20,4,12,Mr Robot,"wow this guy does not think things through also waht are the odds someone with completely different childhood would stay in same apartment etc, from this guys perspective his stories came to life he should have expected this, how is he gonna stay married everyone will notice he is different and doesnt know any of his friends, well his body still exists so why would earthquakes stop, doesnt make sense that earthquakes = parralel universe whats the mechanics of that exactly, overall good show"
2020-01-22,1,1,Watchmen,"20 minutes in, so far quite interesting, I have no idea where this show is going, good so far"
2020-01-22,1,2,Watchmen,"this show is really weird but very gripping and quite interesting, I like it, I'm glad I don't know much about Watchmen other than the movie"
2020-01-22,1,3,Watchmen,everyone seems pretty competent in this show which is good
2020-01-23,1,4,Watchmen,"reveal with asian women as if i know who that is, clark's like superman? i would not sign this form jsut because time runs out because she obviously wants the land now and therefore we dont need to be under pressure, oh i see superman lands after they're gone interesting, even more evidence how time was on those guys sidefs"
2020-01-23,1,5,Watchmen,"see i knew about the squid and i knew it was adrian but i thought it also had psychic attacks and stuff, not sure whats so scary about the squid if it just lay there btw and didnt do anything, alos why did adrian make the video for the president, did he know manhattan would put him on titan or wherever? how did he know that"
2020-01-24,1,6,Watchmen,
2020-01-24,1,7,Watchmen,"what the fuck, hes a dinosaur? or elephant? this shit is fucking weird"
2020-01-24,1,8,Watchmen,"i dont like spontaneous timeloops like presented in the show, no first mover means the universe randomly felt like having a timeloop, hope there werent a lot of post credit scenes"
2020-01-24,1,9,Watchmen,"hitting an old man with a spanner into unconciousness almost certainly kills him, also wtf was lubeman about, never explained, what about that he was an elephant wtf did that have to do with anything. also the machine gun fire didnt do that much damage, i thought it was gonna be like after a nuke | Overall I thought the best parts of the show was the world presentation, especially with Redford and playing into real world events like Tulsa massacare, the show was pretty good when it was about race and stuff. I don't think Dr Manhattan was a good addition or needed to be in the show. Why go straight to the biggest hero? I liked the scenes with Veidt on Europa but seemed pointless. Similarly Trieu did nothing useful. Should've just spent the whole time around some small town racist cult, yeah sure maybe tie in some members of cyclops to bring old grandpa in. Would've been cool if Judd had personally done something with old grandpa like was the reason he had to retire from the police. Anyway the story can be Angela realising her friend was racist and corrupt. Or even if you're gonna keep this stuff have Trieu win and then become Dr Manhattan and have her then just do nothing cause thats what it does to you 
"
2020-01-25,1,1,The Leftovers,"I heard this is good but not to expect answers | what if that guy was just with his own dog, I assume that guy is hutning wild dogs but I don't see how that's how you can go about it, especially only 2% missing. Hope that guy caught his plates. Fucking Americans pledging lol. Wonder how long it took to get an accurate count. I like that the scientists said I don't know. Okay I had low expectations so they commented on plates I'm pleased already. Wow I am surprised that worked. Also these kids have fuck burn and hug on the same game jesus. mnan these are some parties. also im amazed that the guy asked them to leave and it worked. that spin can be a whole turning point for her if the spin  was like a little longer. didnt they think dog might be evidence or something to just bury it. Okay this first episode is great really enjoying it. why dont they learn sign language lol. ok so this stag and dogs thing what the fuck. maybe itll be like the watchmen and raise questions and not answer them. id be worried about shooting when im hallucinating/dreaming

2020-01-26,1,2,The Leftovers,"well not as good as the first episode, still interesting. whats going on with these hallucinations, surely they could fingerprint the truck or find out where it was purchased from, just because the bagels were there doesnt mean anything, why would he think hes imagining fucking bagels, also didnt his daughter talk about the smashed up kitchen or was that a dream, dunno whats going on with the cult guy isnt he from torchwood or something, "
2020-01-27,1,3,The Leftovers,"well I definitely called that he'd been asleep for multiple days, always lucky he's capable of running for this long after waking up and knew where his car was parked and everything, and he didn't eat or anything. still he's up 140k so that's good. pretty crazy that they dont have guards outsides casinos feel like people robbing casino people is common, dude has good aims on the rocks but trying to kill someone is crazy and most importantly what about his wife did they abandon her"
2020-01-28,1,4,The Leftovers,"surprised they're not more worried about their son, also wtf with the baby thing seems random. this cult is weird 
"
2020-01-28,1,5,The Leftovers,"damn these people are fucking mental jesus christ, throwing rocks at her seems way ott. i guess she cant call for the urgency do they text or do what, how will they signal that they found her, so thats the cop right. hmm why is she telling him what happened if he was there, well im hella confused about the shirts, are they not his shirts, dont his shirts have the police on them, or what they just didnt give his shirts wtf. fairly confused about the bother with incinerating the cult members, why go to so much effort 
"
2020-01-28,1,6,The Leftovers,"surely they have cctv of the bar couldve used that
"
2020-01-28,1,7,The Leftovers,"fucking gramps perfect timing so much going on , i was reading reddit thread and these people seem so mad about this show, jesus. There's a quality to this TV show that makes me really willing to let it go far. music, camera, most acting, etc. "
2020-01-28,1,8,The Leftovers,"wow this show i never have any idea where it is going with the kidnapped girl, also has permanently wtf. wow the cult women is super hypocrite.  I totally predicted she'd kill herself and that he'd free her they've done that twice with the bait where it looks like they'll do it then they free them. anyway he can still go confess to it to circumvent her weird issues. People on reddit absolutely fucking suck at just accepting the premise. The premise is 2% of people disappeared and here's some people coping with that. And they're like but how and why did they disappear. The characters don't know, it doesn't matter if the top scientists know or whatever this is how the general public feel and they don't know and if the show even wanted to explain nothing would be fucking satisfying. Aliens, God, nothing would be satisfying. It's better as a mystery if the premise of the show is focusing on how people deal with unknown events that reveal power unknown. "
2020-01-29,1,9,The Leftovers,"holy fuck the baby disappearing in the womb while she's getting an operation, that's fucking crazy. the woman you're cheating with vanishing, must suck for her family cause they dont know if shes gone or missing or whatever. wouldn't that cause a vacuum or whatever in your womb"
2020-01-29,1,10,The Leftovers,"I didn't immediatedly make the connection so I thought everyone had come back, I thought they had aged by 3 years lol. wait so did son and mum run off together, but son didnt know she was part of gr or what happened in those three years right? also who tf just picks up baby like that "
2020-01-30,2,1,The Leftovers,"From this intro I expect a different cast but because of the credits it seems like it is the same cast. Did they get replaced by air or by a vacuum. Lol the intro song says let the mystery be. is this the wrong show wtf is this intro. it said do not drink water on the sign. rip them. im interested in it being a new cast. omg is the actress from watchmen what are the odds. who has the biography of lenin in their room. who cycles in the middle of the road. why they all driving golfcarts. dude moved on top of a column. there must be a few places with departures of zero but its a good concept for a place. oh hes gonna be using the water from the lake and spreading the poison or something. So after the departure a bunch of people got prediction powers? or they just BSing because people think magic real after depature. omg yay matt is still in it he was the best character. hmmm they've all moved to miracle that seems weird must be hard for people to move in. did they really put pies at everyones door before they moved in. Did Aimee just disappear out of nowhere? Remember last season she just walked out and that was that. Wonder if we'll come back to her randomly. You'd think they'd be better organised if they get regular earthquakes, like not have things on the wall. So those three kids were sucked into the crack in the ground and now they being fracked by oil companies. Reading reddit comments is better this season but omg there's so much themes and shit that I had no idea about. I didn't even realise it was meant to be a cricket hiding in the house. That makes more sense than a bird."

I dunno if you can trust random old guy or an instituion that lets you granddad go, hard choices"
2020-02-02,2,9,The Leftovers,"I am almost certain that I saw him earlier in like episode 3 or 4 in the crowd for like two frames but no one commented on it on reddit so I just figured it was some other guy. If it turns out I'm right I'll be triggered, worst thing is not being able to comment on old reddit threads. Liz is interesting character, wonder what other characters they'll expand on in s3"
2020-02-02,2,10,The Leftovers,"Wait what, the earthquake was at 2am, that woke her parents, presumably the earthquake released the water, they were meant to be back before 11pm so they obviously left earlier and I doubt its a three hour drive to get there, because my boy had to go to sleep, wake up and then walk there so how could he get there first, and how did he drown for so long, did no one hear his shot? rip kevin. it took an hour for him to get to the church and back the fuck. why dont cops shoot them since they are meant to hate gr and americans love shooting everyone anyway, i dont like that he is either walking with gunshot wound or he is healed. presumably the church is near the centre of the town and that took that guy an hour to get there and back with a car so how tf did he walk it, they take a bus after vistor centre. didnt like this season as much as the previous one"

2020-02-03,3,1,The Leftovers,"Tell you what, things I wasn't expecting, a cut to three years later, also surprised they didn't gun them down seems like it's more visceral and enjoyable for the FBI. I have no idea about symbolism of opening scene. That ending wtf"
2020-02-04,3,2,The Leftovers,"So far not super feeling this episode, 18 minutes in, Nora is mental. Was she not gonna say bye to Kevin. These people don't care about their phones being rekt. I would be so annoyed. Why doesn't she just press the button to call someone on machine. This girl nuts, also what a weird way to creep on Christine, why not just be like hey Christine I'm in town want to have lunch with the kids, why she gotta be so creepy? Christine gonna understand if you want to see Lily. Nora the retard doesn't think about the long term consquences of a tattoo... wow she definitely not going crazy cause she already is"
2020-02-04,3,3,The Leftovers,"Cool episode, Kevin Sr. is also crazy, also no one going to comment on ripping out the catheter, wouldn't that severely injure him? I like how many connections people can make about this show. Like the singing in the hotel and now theme, and all the other stuff"
2020-02-05,3,4,The Leftovers,"WTF bus driver stopped, she didn't say thanks or pay. So Laurie is a pyschologist and she told Kevin, who she knows well, to not do something and then she told him to stop doing something. So she knows full well that what he's gonna do and she's reverse pyschology or the writers are retarded"
2020-02-09,3,5,The Leftovers,"I got interrupted watching this, so I watched the first half like three days ago. Pretty sure lions don't live to 90s but maybe it's metaphorical. Nope 91, wtf. Oldest lion on record is 30, why even make it literal, well maybe it's not. Lol why doesn't she just explain it, look here is facebook of girl she saw, here are the messages with them. Apparently the lion was a reference to something biblical, but still could've made it 91 months or weeks or something"

2020-02-09,3,7,The Leftovers,"Wait was he really just drowning, did he go to bed instead of doing it when he arrived? Why would he wait all night, wtf seems weird man. The timing on this is silly. omg is it dog manh to rescue him. Really thought the dog thing would come up"
2020-02-09,3,8,The Leftovers,"I'm surprised with all of this effort they wouldn't bother having a practice session first but maybe since apparently just showing up they'll do it it won't be forced. Dude wtf she seems terrified, my guess is she was old and he isn't but it's not true. So wtf he just stalked her for the rest of his life, and wait wtf, was this all imagined. My new guess is that she made it through and this is the other world but I guess nothing will be explained but I don't see how this adds or improves the story though. Can I just say I am annoyed at her for pussying out after all that bother. Holy shit I am so mad at both Laurie and Nora and that's their fault because Nora can't say what she wants she would be the worst women she's like oh no I don't want to do this don't do it, but she really emans she wants to, and vice versa for other stuff. She better not go to the dance after all this shit cause it's super creepy if they don't take no for an answer. Fucking kill me I hate Nora so much, where the fuck is she going now, after she got locked in her bathroom she changed her mind what the fuck is going on. I just want the show to be over so I can rant about how annoying Nora is and I saw on reddit a simialrly titled post that I want to read already. How can there be 30 minutes left? Surely it should cut to black with the TV show? Also wtf he obviously wasn't that into her if he waited 20 years or however long this is meant to be. Oh wow she says she can't do this who believes that, fucking Nora cried wolf. Also the acting of them being old is terrible, and makeup, old people dye their grey hair these days. What are the odds on this timing all hte time. Also bullshit do they actually release the goat. Why would they do that. It's hard to feel sympathy for her when she's so annoying. Why doesn't she use the fence to climb. Dude couldn't think of a better way to search Australia for 2 weeks of the last 20 years? Couldn't post online or something. Thought he had a flight to catch anyway. Why did she even stay if this was gonna be her life? She didn't even think about this? God she's so dumb, also surely people would be more concentrated in the 2% of the world since I guess way more people would die, especially to wild animals. Like Australia would probably be abandoned, why she didn't find a car to drive and all that stuff. Why did that guy build it in Australia, did she go back to Australia? Also how did no one think about appearing naked that's what I thought about. Also why did she even go back if she was just gonna go sit in Austraila and do nothing. Why the fuck wouldn't he believe you he's fucking Jesus what the fuck I hate Nora. How come their clothes went with them on only one side? Everything else got duplicated right? Like cars and stuff"

In principle I'm not opposed to him losing to the fight to gain access. Also nanobots are op. is he stabbing himself just to remember it"
2020-02-29,2,2,Altered Carbon,
2020-02-29,2,3,Altered Carbon,"Surely the people wearing night vision gear would be best suited to a lights out situation, so not sure how turning off the lights made them fight better. Feel like this season has been worse. The fight scenes seem pretty shit. A lot of telling about how OP those two are without really explaining why they're better than 20 men. Sure, 2 or 3 good men. But people underestimate numbers. Has there ever been any real fighter who can beat 20 men?"
2020-03-01,2,4,Altered Carbon,"How does the AI not know when someone as an AI? Just not feeling this show. The writing always falls flat, I don't like most of the editting or camera work. The stuff with poe should be a really complex decision, basically someone with Alzhimers choosing to die and let their body live which will have similar personality traits and can be told or not. It's a fascinating thing. Imagine people who are clumsy and the guy just assumes they were in the war. Who tf isn't worth preserving AI throwing shade. Also so lucky to stumble across Archivist. And why the fuck didn't he consider that"
2020-03-01,2,5,Altered Carbon,"Started going on reddit and everyone else is complaining about the show. Are humans always killing themselves? Got to imagine the fast majority of stacks don't die, way less than now I doubt anyone would say now. I assume the founders killed the Elders or something btw. Wow this guy sure is lucky that command prompts haven't changed in 300 years. what's the point of him being 3 centuries out of date if nothing has changed. Also I don't understand why she even hung around to be caught and interrogated. Smart enough to back up her memory and yet not smart enough to prepare for the rest. She just said she only looks out for herself and no one else, immediatedly does something for someone else. Absolutely needless destruction of that, what if in the memory they had some really big clue like bank details, literally no upside to destroying that"
2020-03-04,2,6,Altered Carbon,"If she hadn't put a knot at the end of the rope it would have been long enough. What the fuck was with that music, who cares if he falls that far, the sleeve will just be fine. Why wouldn't you foreshadow the subconscious reflexes to not make it seem like a bullshit. I don't understand why so much of this show is fist fights. WOAH ANOTHER LAST SECOND RESCUE WOW SO TENSION SO GREAT AMAZING WOW, damn lamp shading it too. So many fist fights, they should have made this show. Imagine having everyone in line of sight and shooting one guy and letting all the other ones run to the tree without hitting them. So dumb. Why would literally all of their guys shoot at one target? I mean I don't get why she can block bullets anyway since that shit requires magic. Also even I can hit people peeking in PUBG how can they not. Cool af shots though, none of them reconsider when she ahs eternal power on her? The whole world will see eternal sats shooting down"

2020-08-31,2,1,Umbrella Academy,"I don't know how I feel about this show. In some ways it was interesting but only at the most shallow of levels. There seems to be no real depth and it's just pieced together action scenes. They had the whole world to play with and they chose 60s USA as if that's not been done enough. Where's the imagination or something interesting? In addition I always feel the show has bad dialogue, no one speaks like a human and they're always so imprecise with what they want. Like Five wtf just tell them what happened directly. And these white haired guys, wtf am I meant to think about them? What a dumb way to potray an antagonist as idiotic and stupidly violent. They could literally have just asked to see him and shot him then like Five managed. Also the premise that war nuclear war in 1963 would've killed everyone is a terrible premise. At least the moon thing was better even though what we saw of Five's apocaylpse looked nothing like the moon."

2020-09-10,2,5,Umbrella Academy,"Wow I was thinking the death of the Swede was pretty bad and shit but actually the funeral was pretty dope and added depth to their characters that was missing I think. Swedish cover was ok but I think a Jojk would've been a cool song choice to make you even sadder. Still don't like the dialogue especially how unspecific everything, written for one liners at the audience which aren'te ven funny or smirkable, not written as if character's are talking together. Like wtf Vanya would be so confused by the ""technical"" line then just dropping the topic"
2020-09-11,2,6,Umbrella Academy,
2020-09-11,2,7,Umbrella Academy,"That guy was pretty reasonable consider he literally let her live in his house for months and then she cheated with his wife on him. Imagine she was a guy. Fucked up. How does Vanya know anything about the future? Like that lesbians are ok or that mental disorders have names, also wtf she doesn't know anything about the timeline yet she acts arrogant af. It's not like they don't trust him which is a completely different point. IF you don't trust him why do you even want to go to the future or try anything he says? They just make stupid points about the specifics which they are not experts in and seem moronic. Of course I don't know how he knows any of this stuff either"
2020-09-11,2,8,Umbrella Academy,
2020-09-11,2,9,Umbrella Academy,"lul didn't expect that, was he a lizard person. made me laugh, one of the few times this show did. also ben literally got to hug last episode with that cult chick so wtf"
2020-09-12,2,10,Umbrella Academy,"""i cant explain"" yeah no shit vanya no one in this stupid universe is capable of explaining anything you moron, why dont you just say you saw him in your head asking for help wtf, first time in your life wut u talking about what about with sissy. wtf dont these morons know what caused the apocaylpse in the first place then they just ditch her crazy. The commission literally only has bodies, why dont they use a tank or aircraft or nuke seriously pathetic. why are they running, also how did she set up that timing. in addition how does vanya know anything about harlan she has never faced this before and she is not a great actor. why is diego stopping the bullets they dont even do anything. five randomly is too tired as the plot demands it. tanya would get rekt by a missile. seems like a lot of wasted institutional knowledge there... was there any foreshadowing of this at all.. if anyone could survive bricks falling it would be luther. how boring two people fighting without their powers. wtf how did she stop breathing. what incredible things has comission actually done. why do they keep showing flashbacks for the most obvious of shit. what if that killed him taking it back. wtf is that random doubt about fucking stupid person imagine rejecting going to the future"
2020-10-08,2,1,The Boys,"Good return, I liked the arab guys coming up with a theme, "
2020-10-08,2,2,The Boys,"Scenes with Deep kept me tense cause I kept expecting him to rip his gills but lul when it started singing it was great. How did Stormfront get hired anyway to be the rebellious thing? Like swearing and stuff. Also she's like you're bullet proof but people she cares about aren't also Butcher is a moron why you gonna shoot the brother of Kimiko it gonna make her mad and he'd have his head ripped off. How does Kimiko know that those people are even alive, she should assume they're dead, wasn't he trying to kill them? How tf did they find them, and at the perfect time, and these siblings so easily attacked each other, fucking what. Wouldn't anyone have stopped Butcher like the guy who is into her. TBF I didn't realise it was a tranq so if that's all it is it makes it a bit dumb they made such a big deal"
2020-10-08,2,3,The Boys,"Dude has really changed his tune after he got captured lol, if he felt that way maybe he should have said that before he got all tied up. He didn't even eat his breakfast omg I'm so annoyed reee. Same guys complaining about him phoning Annie celebrating his win like wooo. I don't think you get signal 3 miles off shore. Wtf there's a speedboat on the back of the boat, Hugie didn't even go for that. It's a bit to slapstick for me, no one gets anything huh. I love Homelander's character btw. The girl called stormfront killing black people, im fucking shocked lol. How does she even know how his powers work. Also those fuckers swapped back and forth every two seconds. Stormfront is like Homelanders ideal waifu. Also the odds of no one being on video call, or no one being able to tell the bodies were electrocuted, etc"
2020-10-09,2,4,The Boys,I made a video watching this. I should probably write that down when I do that. 
2020-10-09,2,5,The Boys,"The show got my hopes up when homelander lasered the crowd and dashed them when it was just his fantasy. Going that route of him snapping would've been way better, the only show that didn't shy away from doing something like that was Mr Robot"
2020-10-09,2,6,The Boys,"The thing that militia woman is planning wouldn't work if Homelander or we his name is god I suck at names just went awol and that would be a cooler show. Why didn't he shoot straight away? I don't understand why they even want his help. If he's so mad he should have just shot, what is he even waiting for I don't understand it it makes no sense wtf. There's no characters here wtf, also how tf Annie is so useless compared to Billy, and that supe guy didn't seem like he did it on purpose but he got killed for it. Yeah she didn't care about the supe who got killed why would she care about the civvie. You know what, actually embracing Nazi ideology rather than just metaphorically is great. Literally saying hey I'm a Nazi is top stuff, though I'm surprised Homelander doesn't associate Nazis with bad cause of culture but that's what you get for not doing anything. How did the bald girl escape from the place? Didn't she get electrocuted did I miss that"
2020-10-10,2,7,The Boys,"I'm glad they did it but they didn't kill anyone interesting and there's still no explanation for why she only killed the FBI woman or why she was even trailing the FBI woman back in episode 1. And now there's not much justification for why she didn't kill the senator if she's with vought or homelander if she's against it, also do witnesses really come in from the back like that. I predicted the head explosion like two seconds before it happened"
2020-10-10,2,8,The Boys,"All endings are disappointing, what a surface level take, no thoughts to systemic problems with the existence of supes, nah just hope that he's a good one that's it, as if power doesn't corrupt. BTW imagine if Homelander had arrived 30 seconds later and Butcher would have been beating up Ryan"

2020-10-24,1,2,American Gods,Is he gonna die at the end of every episode

Did they really build all that up and then just undo it? Also no one properly talks to each other in this show and that bothers me. Reminds me of late GoT dialogue where it was always random cuts after people finish a fancy line but not after a conversation would actually end. Anyway finales are meant to climax whereas this one did not. I feel like a lot of what the show was going for could have been good but just needed to be a bit more on the nose perhaps, a bit tighter even, fewer random loose ends that get abandoned straight away"

He didn't even use the glasses. also i certainly was mislead on who was gonna be the daughter father combo in this, is the guy she killed his father or just some random guy in whichc ase why is her name there"

They found the casings but I don't think they found the weapon. Well I'm glad it showed it and also good thing he remembered to hide it when he was dying. Well he's lucky he went in the elevator. Dude is confident for a guy killing someone in a public apartment complex isn't he. BTW, the gun shots, the punches and more are all terrible in this show. The CGI etc"
2020-11-01,1,4,Sashiyet,"He spent the entire time wreapping that body in the public area? Good timing that he came home then too and that no one is in the street to spot him,.. what did he do with the body did i miss that it was in the car isnt it. also hte gunfight in the forest whatever episode that was there was no buildup right, but the two guns pointed at his head scene was funny. isnt it weird how every tiome i write something down here it gets resolved in the plot, but like i didnt get the haiji thing at all, ive been messaging Yasemin about it . Wait wasn't the house surrounded by cameras, also jesus christ that's baller . what if anyone had seen him actually doing it i mean not that he couldnt disguise himself, like where did he park"
2020-11-02,1,5,Sashiyet,"This is fight is so unserious compared to the usual state of the show wtf so slapstick and badly acted. Sometimes like the dinner scene its just too over the top wtf.

2020-11-02,1,9,Sashiyet,"everyone brings up his son after he already learned about it huh. bad strategy to go out after a guy who knocked on your door and pointed a gun, also why not look at the cameras, he should've stayed inside and conducted a seige. he didnt kill the altzimers lady too so id unno why they're so surprised. still no one mentioning that he ahsnt killed any women, just the copycat one which didnt have his tags. wait i dont understand why did they - i just realised some of these comments must have been for a different episode. also why do they think they all stood by a did nothing, does it really add up with the entire town stoning the house? isnt that quite supportive. i dont get her mum was she there for ages, like didnt she have another husbadn or did she leave the town and come back was she born there, im thinking she went to have sex with him anyway, actually i thought all the girl stuff was a lie but i guess not, is this a real story? i dunno if any of this is true or if its all part of the story theyre trying to weave, handy that the foreigner raped someone right. i dont understand why these people put so much make up on, what she went to sleep with all that make up then spent an hour putting it all on in the morning. lucky she was last in line and everything. lul she couldnt have just went along with the bus thing, way to be risky for no reason. seriously could have literally got off the bus at hte first stop."
2020-11-02,1,10,Sashiyet,"lol what was he a fucking magician, she wasnt exactly being subtle about following him, also is she crazy doesnt she think hes a bad guy. wow i didnt even think she was from kanbara since she got there so fast, this seems like a lot of projecting. since she didnt even take the bus im surprised she bothered with any of that. also surely she would know that no one would marry a non virgin also u cant check virginity with hymens so did people really do that, what was the failure rate. since they are there they might as well speak to the husband. also her logic seems pretty shit. isnt this set in 2007, why everyone got these modern phones. wait are these the people from kambura or are they romani. also dont they all know shes working on the big serial killer case anyway. even if someone came i thought that they could hide why do they assume she was kidnapped anyway,. that box was way too big for that gun i didnt expect that at all"
2020-11-03,1,11,Sashiyet,"So she was in school for like one year in Kambura and it happened to be then? Or she's been in Kambura for years? Wtf. why did that guy in prison tell her for no reason, also am i a god or what at this. wtf where is his caling card for the teacher. sure is good timing with all these repressed memories huh"
2020-11-03,1,12,Sashiyet,"dude how arnnoyed are you if you're cemil that his son happened to die on this day, god talk about unlucky. the one week thing seems pretty shit to me. cemil is still alive and firuz quit or what? is cemil not gonna be like wtf tell me who it was or ill kill u? since hes so meticolous aren't they ognna be confused af about the lips. if she was chained up why didn't her gran come and see what was happening. you know if she hadnt repressed her memories wouldnt this have been a completely different story, like what are the odds she never met cemil anyway, she phoned him didnt she. wouldnt you be able to smell it, they never point that out in this stuff you got to imagine these hillbillies stink . arent there lots of guys still without crosses? also it works perfectly for nerva to shoot the main guy when he shot the person. also wtf what bait is that with ates, or is it the name of the kid, kind of fucked up to name ur kid after ur temp boyfriend. pretty good show overall, not perfect, a few problems, but not bad. great soundtrack. bit too many coincedences. also i dont like that he said that the rapist ruined her life, her life was fine, isnt it giving them too much power to say that"
2020-11-07,1,1,Utopia,"Dude's just out here giving his address online like that, plus the odds of them all being in London. Also all their usernames just being names with no other characters, so 2013. i swear i saw the intro bit in the comic shop before but i dont remember any of this, glad the guy survived, i thought thery were gonna kill him and make the escape scene pointless, what's he been in before, was it four lions?, also got me interested"

Seems like he wasn't gonna shoot, who gives a countodnw, probably he's like them that he's been forced to do this stuff against his will. shouldn't he wear a hazmat suit, can't he ask for one, seems silly. why not just shoot her and take the manuscript? seems random. I like that he shot her mother and I like that this guy gets caught all the time, unusual ain't it for a show. "
2020-11-08,1,4,Utopia,"Dude this is a game of chicken the guy should just stand his ground, the big organisation has way more to lose over this than he does, if you're willing to go to the desk surely you have to expect that they'll threaten your wife, you just have to risk it"
2020-11-08,1,5,Utopia,"Did he say the sterlisation is hereditary? lol, ok never mind it made sense. tell you what worker rights gonna be great in that new world, think about the impact of black plague. surely she flicked through the manuscript when she was in the girl's house. Dude should have brought his wife into the know didn't he learna nything from that"
2020-11-09,1,6,Utopia,"Does it really make much sense than the whole conspiracy would end just cause of Mr Rabbit? seems like a lot of people believe in it and in that world there are actual problems with food riots and stuff. Good concidence that everything is in the UK and also the test country was the UK, I don't remember that line. If she knows the name is in the last pages then why didn't she just fucking read the pages? How would she know without reading it or spending two seconds to look? What are the odds he copied exactly every number? I thought he was drawing from memory, he was just copying it? Might as well use a photocopier, also if I was Grant I'd go for the taser, just got to grab the taser.  Shouldn't one of them have a name? As if no one who looked at it would notice the drawing would not notice that pages linked"

All this boring fucking arguing about killing and Wilson not being a killer he's already killed 3 people. Them arguing together is so dumb. Why don't people just shoot instantly? Why bother talking to these people it would be better if they just shot the moment they saw them. Is Grant's behaviour really accurate? All he needs is a woman to tell him what to do? Maybe so, but I doubt he listened to his mother or his teachers. I do not care enough about the characters to genuinely be interested in their morality, this story is only interesting cause of the plot, not cause of the characters, it should learn that. Just casually talking about all this in front of the firemen lol. Why did she shoot from so far back instead of in the cars, why was she standing instead of hiding by a car, why just a pistol, AR would be better. she's terrible at using cover, you know if he had died she wouldn't have shot up the car, she only did it because he got out the car, when have you ever seen someone light up the car, also pointing an unloaded gun like a moron. how did she know where he even went. why do they only have UK based virus releasers, how did he know to wait behind that exact spot and stab him, so dumb, fuck me this guy is a moron. how does he even know the release mechanism what is he waitingf for what a moron, wow nails a headshot with eyes cclosed. isnt he in a hospital? and he doesnt call for help? dude good fucking luck getting the character right doing it on yourself and you aren't used to writing chinese"

2020-11-25,1,2,Suurmestari,"Not sure about switching contestants out, I liked that contestant, also is there no grand prize. So perhaps the random contestant gets the tasks given to them much later? Or is this organised adminstratively? I can't imagine they do it simulatenously as then it might be hard to schedule guests and you'd be forced to choose only these tasks for the show. Why did everyone get 4 points, sure it's fast but sometimes it's confusing. After the 100 seconds she should have said ""and now you may start unspooling"". i thought of the knife idea.
