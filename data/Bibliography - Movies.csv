I hate when they say it's too dangerous as if even a suicide mission would be too dangerous, wtf does that mean. Do you think that people fighitng the battle of britain or whatever were like you guys this might be dangerous even though we can win the war. Oh wow Chewie survived how boring, also the force fight was so dumb, why wouldn't she just force pull the engine switch to off first, and how did it not get ripped up when they were fighting. Wouldn't it be funny if they all died to the water. What shit attempts at raising tension as if anyone is gonna believe she gonna die from ocean or by falling no in fight with Kylo. Nice of that fake version of her to disappear when she ran into Kylo, would've been funny if she killed Kylo then couldn't get to exakil. imagine if one of those weapons got taken over by terrorists. they didn't even win for fifty years I don't know why they're so proud of defeating the empire. how is that shit ship that was underwater for years gonna be better than modern rebel ships fucking so annoying. How the fuck do they know how the fuck to destroy these brand new ships they've never seen? Why do ships always come with big weakness. Imagine if this happened IRL, don't worry about the Hood guys just shoot the turrets and it'll all blow they would never armour the turrets to avoid that. Just think how much steel that is, why would you keep every single one of the ships in one big formation jesus talk about eggs in one basket. Could've came in below like Rey did but no they light speed above it. If they had two or multiple Star Destroyer's already up, and they even forgot to kill the nav tower. Also how will people coming know it's the real resistance and not bait and also why the fuck does anyone led a boarding vessel get that close jesus and also why don'tr good guys wear armour, ww2 everyone had helmet. what are those red guys gonna do? shoot her? plan won't work if she dies. also really weird plan in general. also who is doing all this research on force btw that everyone knbows about dyads and shit. also if palp is human then wtf why did anyone think he was ok as senate leader. great timing on the things, also they're still gonna slaughter millions of slaves basically cause they know clonetroopers are just slave. oh wow zori is alive guess all those other billions on that planet are irrelevant wow this movie is great at undermining itself. anyway shooting one gun doesn't save a planet why can't one gun shoot 20 planets is it really only one shot. didn't she strike him down as he wanted her too. why didn't it work there mr scientist palp. Dude if they're stuck why do you ahve to massacre them might as well use the ships for mining or hospital ships or wahtever",
2020-04-24,,Parasite,,"In Korean, enjoyed this movie, not quite sure it's the best movie ever or whatever the oscars were for but it is better than most so really good. Only quibble I have is that no one would research where the guy came from. And surely the housekeeper has gone missing too. She has no bills or the son who was messaging her still so her kakao will suddenly be quiet. After all the blood will be of a crime scene where the main character was knocked out and that's right next to the basement no one will wonder why they're down there. The OG house owner won't mention it?",

I am happy that I have travelled so much and experienced people's lives because I feel like I can empathise more with the experiences shown. Like washing yourself with just a bucket, never done that until I travelled. I wasn't expecting that ending at all, when the interviews started I was really impressed and happy with the movie. Definitely can see the similarities with Parasite, a lot more grounded though. Only issue was I think the Japanese subtitles lack a lot of the subtext that dialogue carries didn't feel that as much as in Parasite. Especially early on there seem to be a lot of nonsequtiours ",

2020-06-08,,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,,"Rewatch, I don't like the writing in this movie, seems unrealistic. So far. I don't like old Dumbledore either. Also they're spending lots of time talking about the glory of the cup, eternal glory. Name a single other winner. Fucking bs. Also they talk about hard it is to see if someone's under the imperius but you go do it with truth serum or imperius. Also wtf you have no choice anyway, what does binding even mean, couldn't he just fail every task? Ez fucking pz. Also the difference in Dumbledore's confidence between this movie and the previous is really annoying. Also is it Harry's handwriting. Also how come at the world cup, that happened to be hosted in Britain, no one else was there, like how does the minister rather than a referee start the match. Also I was thinking in the first few movies how annoying it must be to have Harry Potter interrupt every class. I wanted to write a story from perspective of ""ordinary student"". Like Harry won the house cup again, Harry got defence class cancelled, Harry got to ride a buckbeak, Harry did this do that. Why do they have the draw hidden? They should have it out and public so everyone can get excited about it. Also I like awkward Filch in this, seems more realistic. ""Dress robes"" says Ron. Who knows the answer? Fucking muggleborn Hermione. HOW DID SHE POSSIBLY READ ABOUT DRESS ROBES. IS THAT REALLY WHAT SHE'S INTERESTED IN? What kind of book would you ever start at? are there books that cover culture of hogwarts/wizarding world? i just get annoyed in these movies that hermione literally does everything. every quesiton about wizarding culture it should be ron who can answer, not hermione. Also if it's on christmas eve are christmas holidays cancelled. Surprised they have acne in wizarding world. Figure neville's grandmother would have taught him about that stuff. I think the stuff with awkward teenagers is pretty funny and well written though. Like Ron and Harry not talking and Harry stumbling over the words with Cho. Also wouldn't like suits by seen as out of fashion caues its muggle clothes. I wonder what yeras go the ball. think it's 4th+? I forgot about the dance music. I also forgot about Neville and Ginny going, that's way better than Harry and Ginny. Also where do they go to get laid, empty classrooms probably I guess. All of these are terrible spectator sports. I do not understand Harry's motive for wanting to win. Why does he run at the cup anyway? He already said he doesn't want eternal glory, also these wizards suck at using wands. What kind of spells cause a lot of branches. They showed how a portkey work then immediatedly make it different. Early on they talked about how dangerous it is. but how is that fun? who wants to win something because your opponents died, so depressing. also wtf kind of question is ""is he in this room"" rather than ""where is he"". I don't like how Dumbledore is so straight about knowing everything in this film. It's better if he's roundabout. Also they should have made the wizarding population bigger. Or at least decided on it. Like isn't Hogwarts meant to be Eton so there should be other schools that aren't foreign to compare with. Like the Weasley's can be poor but they are at Hogwarts cause of like being grandfathered in and say muggleborns have literally just been allowed/been able to afford to attend. So maybe Granger is there cause of Muggleborn Scholarship by Dumbledore which would be another thing people could be mad at her about. Since Muggleborn shit is about to be race relations. So like they only accept 40 kids in a year and most are pure born, top of the spot. It explains why all these students will end up being involved in the ministry and other important jobs. ",

The movies seem ok. Also feels like Severus isn't all that cool a guy. Sure he helped a bit but like why put the sword under the ice to risk Harry dying.

Dude really gonna last until he's 70 years old is he? I mean what age is he? How does it even work? fucking miracle man not brought up ever before that dumb af. lol wtf the jewish actor plays a stingy guy . dude they don't know that the husband is gonna kill his wife, so why are they so worried about that. holocaust cloak who tf knows what that is, why did htey go on a honeymoon when that was invented in 19th century. good thing his head recovered so fast. why does he care so much about the actual wedding anyway. why does no one use ranged weapons btw. why leave him alone why not just bring him around the corner, not much of a point there. imagine going straight to suicide when you can't marry the person you want lol. dude allready ran away once why not runaway again, also isnt he lucky that the sword blade in his arm didnt ruin his muscles? the fights sure are meaningless arent they. fucking what a dumb fucking argument, if that was the technicality then he'd make him say it. sure is good timing with the muscles huh. dude was shouting at how many walls before that. imagine if he missed her, also this guy jumping out a window with 3 injuries is def dead. how much do you have to jerk off yourself about your movie to have the kid ask for it again lol",

Thought the girl was not worth it, international lawyer and she doesn't even go to Europa why did he take her back, she had enough chances, also the warning shots were pointless, as were the holding hands, not like that's gonna make a difference, might as well start with the seals, also on wikipedia there wasn't much info, like about the car or the planes or w/e, also did they all lose their bribes and still lose anyway? how about the guys father, etc?",
2021-01-25,,Wonder Woman,,"With Mori over Skype, trash, nothing makes sense, poor motivation, its basically saying that she was fine sitting by doing nothing with Hitler and Pol Pot and all the other guys but she can't stop herself from saving random people?",
2021-01-30,,Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,,"With Mori over Discord, I cannot believe anyone would spend that much on animation and also spend so little on dialogue or coherent plot. The guy ignores a direct order from his commander then two seconds later is like oh that's government property, I play by the rules, unironically I thought it was a joke",
2021-02-02,,Woman Woman 1984,,"With Mori over Skype, the problem with watching with someone is that I vent the entire movie and then afterwards I'm satisfied and don't need to write down all my complaints, which is disappointing for future Ross as I have no transcript of my rants, Is hould figure out how to do that. Anyway this movie was dumb, what if someone wished for something good like world peace or other contractiorary things, what if someone wished their lover was alive or something and didn't want to give it up, how about when he spoke English to the whole world and 99% of them wouldn't understand him anyway, he didn't bother translating it, also why did he take their health and go organ by organ cause wouldn't taking their life force kill him? Why not get someone to wish for his immortality? Also what was his plan next week after everyone used up their wish? In addition Steve wished for something when they were handcuffed yet the wish didn't go off",
2021-02-07,,Tenet,,"With Mori over Skype, I have a lot of praise for this movie. Fast paced, makes you have to think differently. However, the philisophy is still not right. The solution to the grandfather paradox, and acting in reverse time is that you don't have a choice. There is no free will. You cannot kill your grandfather, you can only do things that already happened. And they seem to get that but they don't really. Of course it excuses all actions because it means that the people in the future have to send it back in time even if they think it's dumb. And no matter what he said to that guy at the end he'd always choose to go back in there because it's literally impossible for him to do otherwise. I hate when a scientist invents something then stops because it just kicks the can down the road, some scientist will invent it again in 100, or 1000 years. Especially the last hour went really quickly I felt which was really good. The scenes in the container to show time passage. Also they must acknowledge this philisophy because if they don't then there's no downside to meeting yourself or to not going back into the room. It already happened so you don't have to do it again. Also when he did the bullet test he should have had to undepress the trigger right, start it down and then release it but did he do that? She didn't explain that until she explained the dropping thing right. Also it's annoying how the mass murderer hitman was such a pussy about killing women like for real who cares compared to world ending",
2021-02-13,,Tsumetai nettaigyo,,"With Mori over Skype, wow what a terrible movie",
2021-02-16,,Unfriended,,"With Mori over Skype, you know not that bad, I remember watching the review with YMS",
2021-02-21,,I'm Thinking Of Ending Things,,"With Mori over Skype, we watched it over two days, also I forgot to add this until later which is very bad of me, was a weird movie, Mori didn't like it but it wasn't that bad, would be better if you knew the references I guess I swear I have seen that dog shaking scene before somewhere",
2021-02-23,,The Edge of Seventeen,,"With Mori over Skype, pretty funny, ",
2021-02-24,,I Care A Lot,,"With Mori over Skype, good start, disappointing middle, pretty good end, was happy with the end even before she died",
2021-02-26,,The Witches,,"With Mori over Skype, started the day before, one of the worst movies I've seen in recent time, actually even worse than Tsumetai maybe, I don't know, both really bad movies",
2021-03-06,1994,Leon: The Professional,,"With Mori over Skype, good movie, Natalie Portman acted well",
2021-03-12,,Train to Busan,,"With Mori via Skype, why are zombie movies all written so badly, at least when complaining about them it's fun but I started watching second movie and quit because I can't handle two in a row, also I feel like in vocalizing all my thoughts to Mori live during the movie then i have much less incentive to write it down ",
2021-03-13,,The Gentleman,,"With Mori via Skype, Matthew and the reporter were dumb",
2021-03-20,,Oblivion,,"With Mori via Skype, so obvious but apparently I watched the CinemaSins back in 2014 so maybe I just remembered since then, feels like a movie I could tear apart bit by bit but I'll never put the effort in to do so",
2021-03-27,,A Sun,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10883506/,"With Mori via Skype, quite enjoyed that movie",
